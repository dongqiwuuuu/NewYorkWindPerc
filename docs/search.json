    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe study of meteorological elements and their interrelationships is a fascinating and complex field of research. Among these elements, temperature, wind, and precipitation stand out due to their profound impact on our environment and daily life. This research project delves into exploring the associations between these three critical weather components, aiming to uncover patterns and correlations that might exist in varying climatic conditions.\nTemperature is a key driver of our planet’s climate system. It influences numerous aspects of the natural world, including weather patterns, ocean currents, and ecosystems. In human contexts, temperature affects agricultural productivity, energy usage, and overall health and well-being. The extremes of temperature, such as heatwaves and cold spells, have particularly significant impacts, making the study of temperature variations and their effects an area of great interest and importance.\nWind, characterized by its direction and speed, is a dynamic and influential climate force. It plays a crucial role in weather systems, acting as both a modifier and a messenger of change. Wind patterns contribute to heat distribution, storm formation, and precipitation dynamics. The study of wind is not only vital for understanding weather patterns but also for applications in sectors like aviation, marine navigation, and renewable energy.\nPrecipitation, encompassing rain, snow, sleet, and hail, is essential for life. It influences water availability, shapes landscapes, and affects agricultural practices. The distribution, frequency, and intensity of precipitation events are critical in understanding water cycles, managing water resources, and preparing for extreme weather events like floods and droughts.\nWe, therefore, want to explore interactions and correlations between these variables, because it is not linear or straightforward. These elements interact in complex ways, influenced by geographic location, topography, and changing climate conditions. This research project aims to explore these interactions, seeking to answer questions such as how temperature variations influence wind patterns and precipitation, and vice versa.\nFurthermore, we believe that, understanding the associations between temperature, wind, and precipitation is pivotal for a range of applications. It informs weather forecasting, climate modeling, and environmental management. In the context of climate change, where shifts in these parameters are becoming increasingly evident, this research project might provide ideas for more methodologies of predicting future climate scenarios and formulating adaptation strategies.\nIn short, this study, by analyzing the intricate relationships between temperature, wind, and precipitation, aims to contribute valuable insights into meteorology and climatology. The findings are expected to enhance our understanding of weather systems and provide a basis for informed decision-making in various sectors affected by weather and climate."

    "text": "2.1 Research plan\nOur dataset, encompassing over 40 diverse meteorological elements such as temperature extremes, precipitation, wind speed, and direction, offers a comprehensive platform for examining the interactions between these various weather components. Specifically, we aim to delve into how wind conditions correlate with patterns of precipitation and temperature changes. This exploration is expected to yield insights into the complex dynamics that govern weather systems.\nMoreover, the inclusion of data from 312 observation stations across New York enhances the depth of our study by enabling regional comparisons. This aspect is particularly valuable as it allows us to analyze how precipitation trends and wind patterns differ across various locations, thereby providing a more nuanced understanding of regional climatic behaviors. Specifically, we are focusing on the three airports near New York.\nAdditionally, the dataset’s up-to-date time series data is crucial for our investigation into the temporal variations and trends of temperature and precipitation. By analyzing this data, we can uncover how these patterns evolve over the course of the year, offering a window into the seasonal shifts and long-term trends in weather conditions. Overall, this dataset serves as a vital tool in our quest to unravel the intricate relationships between precipitation, temperature, and wind and their implications on a regional and temporal scale."

This issue is particularly pronounced when attempting to explore correlations, such as between wind and precipitation, where data is notably lacking. Consequently, to enhance the robustness of our analysis, we’ve decided to narrow our focus.\nWe’ve identified five regions with the most complete datasets, which are pivotal for a more reliable and detailed examination. These regions include Canoe Brook, Boonton, LaGuardia Airport, Newark Liberty International Airport, and JFK International Airport. Among these regions, the airport data are the most complete, and it makes more sense to do a direct comparison between different airports in New York City instead of comparing the airport and a random city. By concentrating on Airports, we aim to mitigate the impact of widespread data gaps and garner more insightful, accurate conclusions about weather patterns and their implications."

The line graph shows similar patterns between the different airports, which is expected given their geographical proximity. These trends align with the historical weather patterns in the region, where the rainy season in New York typically starts in April and continues until June. However, we can still spot abnormal trends in the graph. Notably, there is a peak in precipitation in September at all three locations, which is usually outside the typical rainy season in New York. These observations align with news reports indicating that the total rainfall in September was the second highest in over 150 years in New York.\nApart from the general precipitation pattern, there are slight variations in the trends between the different airports. With other months being roughly equal, precipitation in September at Newark Airport is significantly lower than at the other two airports. This difference could be attributed to the distinct geographic locations of the airports. LaGuardia and JFK are situated on the same peninsula, unlike Newark, which could account for the disparities in precipitation patterns.\n##Relationship between Precipitation, Wind, and Temperature\n\n\nCode\nSlope_data &lt;- data_top5 %&gt;%\n  filter(NAME %in% c(\"LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, NY US\", \"NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NJ US\", \"JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NY US\"))\n\n# Group by airport and month, then calculate the monthly average\nmonthly_avg &lt;- Line_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(NAME, Month = floor_date(DATE, \"month\")) %&gt;%\n  summarise(MonthlyPrec = mean(PRCP, na.rm = TRUE), MonthlyWindSpeed = mean(AWND, na.rm = TRUE), MonthlyTempreture= mean(TAVG, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'NAME'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nCode\nggparcoord(monthly_avg, columns=3:5, scale=\"uniminmax\", groupColumn = \"NAME\") +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Airport\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Monthly Averages of Wind Speed, Precipitation, and Temperature\",\n       x = \"Variables\",\n       y = \"Normalized Values\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")\n\n\n\n\n\nOur primary interest in this New York weather dataset is to explore how wind speed and temperature correlate with precipitation in different areas. The parallel coordinate graphs, grouped by the three airports, reveal distinct relationships between these three variables. Firstly, it’s clear that after normalization, the monthly wind speed at Newark Airport shows a significant decrease compared to monthly precipitation, unlike the other two airports on Long Island Peninsula. The blue lines representing Newark in the graph for monthly wind speed are concentrated towards the bottom, whereas the red and green lines, representing LaGuardia and JFK, are more focused towards the top. This suggests that Newark is more likely to experience lower wind speeds for a given level of precipitation.\nThe relationship between these variables for LaGuardia and JFK also differs slightly. Despite being geographically close, JFK often has slightly higher wind speeds for similar levels of precipitation. However, there is no distinct pattern observed between temperature and monthly precipitation. The lines for the temperature variable are mixed up, indicating a less clear relationship between temperature and precipitation at these locations.\n\n\nCode\n# Precipitation VS Wind Speed\nHeat_data &lt;- data_top5 %&gt;%\n  filter(NAME %in% c(\"LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, NY US\", \"NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NJ US\", \"JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NY US\"))\n\n# Binning the PRCP and AWND data\nHeat_data$Binned_PRCP &lt;- cut(Heat_data$PRCP, breaks = 10)\nHeat_data$Binned_AWND &lt;- cut(Heat_data$AWND, breaks = 10)\n\n# Creating a new data frame for the heatmap\nheatmap_data &lt;- Heat_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(NAME, Binned_PRCP, Binned_AWND) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Frequency = n(), .groups = 'drop')  # Counting occurrences\n\n# Plotting the heatmap\nggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = Binned_AWND, y = Binned_PRCP, fill = Frequency)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ NAME, scales = \"free\", nrow = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Precipitation vs Wind Speed for Three Airports\",\n       y = \"Binned Precipitation (PRCP)\",\n       x = \"Binned Wind Speed (AWND)\",\n       fill = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above heatmap shows the distribution of Wind Speed and Precipitation. The most frequent occurrences (darkest shade) appear in the lower bins of both wind speed and precipitation, suggesting that lower wind speeds and lower precipitation amounts are most common across all three airports. There are noticeable frequencies in higher wind speed bins (around 16.8-19.1) for the JFK International Airport, independent of precipitation levels, indicating occasional higher wind speeds regardless of rainfall. In contrast, frequencies in high wind speed of Laguardia airport and Newark Airport is low.\n\n\nCode\n# Precipitation VS Temperature\n\n# Binning the PRCP and TAVG data\nHeat_data$Binned_PRCP &lt;- cut(Heat_data$PRCP, breaks = 10)\nHeat_data$Binned_TAVG &lt;- cut(Heat_data$TAVG, breaks = 10)\n\n# Creating a new data frame for the heatmap\nheatmap_data &lt;- Heat_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(NAME, Binned_PRCP, Binned_TAVG) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Frequency = n(), .groups = 'drop')  # Counting occurrences\n\n# Plotting the heatmap\nggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = Binned_TAVG, y = Binned_PRCP, fill = Frequency)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"darkblue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ NAME, scales = \"free\", nrow = 3) +\n  labs(title = \"Precipitation vs Temperature for Three Airports\",\n       y = \"Binned Precipitation (PRCP)\",\n       x = \"Binned Temperature (TAVG)\",\n       fill = \"Frequency\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"right\", \n        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap between temperature and Precipitation across all three airport showed similar distribution patterns. Generally, lower levels of precipitation are common across various temperature ranges. We see that the frequency of occurrences generally decreases as precipitation increases, regardless of temperature.\nFrom this analysis, there is no clear pattern to suggest a strong correlation between temperature and precipitation; instead, each variable seems to vary independently.\n##Distribution pattern among three variables\n\n\nCode\nsp_data &lt;- data_top5 |&gt; \n  filter(NAME %in% c(\"LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, NY US\", \"NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NJ US\", \"JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NY US\")) |&gt; \n  filter(!is.na(TAVG) & !is.na(PRCP) & !is.na(AWND)) |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(TAVG, PRCP, AWND, NAME) |&gt; \n  dplyr::rename(\n    \"Temperature\" = TAVG,\n    \"Precipitation\" = PRCP,\n    \"WindSpeed\" = AWND\n  )\n\nsp_jfk &lt;- sp_data |&gt; \n  dplyr::filter(NAME == \"JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NY US\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(Temperature, Precipitation, WindSpeed)\nplot(sp_jfk, pch = 16, cex = .3, main = \"Scatterplot Matrix for JFK\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsp_nwk &lt;- sp_data |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(NAME == \"NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NJ US\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(Temperature, Precipitation, WindSpeed)\nplot(sp_nwk, pch = 16, cex = .3, main = \"Scatterplot Matrix for NWK\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsp_lga &lt;- sp_data |&gt;\n  dplyr::filter(NAME == \"LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, NY US\") |&gt; \n  dplyr::select(Temperature, Precipitation, WindSpeed)\nplot(sp_lga, pch = 16, cex = .3, main = \"Scatterplot Matrix for LGA\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our comparative analysis using separate scatter plot matrices for the three selected variables, we observe similar distributions across all associations between temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. The scatter plots indicate a potential tri-modal distribution between average temperature and precipitation. Specifically, at temperatures around 40°F, 60°F, and 75°F, there is an apparent increase in precipitation levels. This pattern suggests that certain temperature ranges may be associated with heightened precipitation. However, outliers are also present, characterized by extremely low temperatures or exceptionally high precipitation. These outliers hint at sporadic extreme weather conditions, which are consistent across the three airports, likely due to their proximity to each other in the New York area. The relationship between precipitation and average wind speed, on the other hand, is more ambiguous. A general trend of lower precipitation at extreme wind speeds is noted, but with the presence of outliers indicating unusually high wind speeds. These deviations suggest occasional instances of strong winds, which may not necessarily correspond with significant precipitation. Regarding the correlation between average temperature and average wind speed, the data reveals no obvious linkage, implying a potential independence between these two variables. A notable observation is that extreme wind speeds often coincide with lower temperatures, although this does not establish a causal relationship. Overall, while certain patterns and trends are discernible in the data, the presence of outliers and the complexity of environmental variables underscore the nuanced nature of these meteorological phenomena.\n##Examine the relationship between dependent and independent variables as categorical variables\n\n\nCode\ncategorize_data &lt;- function(data) {\n  data |&gt; \n    mutate(\n      Temperature = cut(Temperature, breaks = c(-Inf, 45, 55, 65, 75, Inf), labels = c(\"Very Cold\", \"Cold\", \"Mild\", \"Comfortable\", \"Hot\")),\n      Precipitation = cut(Precipitation, breaks = c(-Inf, 0.1, 0.5, 1, Inf), labels = c(\"No Rain\", \"Light\", \"Moderate\", \"Heavy\")),\n      WindSpeed = cut(WindSpeed, breaks = c(-Inf, 6, 12, Inf), labels = c(\"Calm\", \"Mild\", \"Windy\"))\n    )\n}\n\ncat_jfk &lt;- categorize_data(sp_jfk)\ncat_nwk &lt;- categorize_data(sp_nwk)\ncat_lga &lt;- categorize_data(sp_lga)\n\n\nmosaic(Precipitation ~ Temperature + WindSpeed, data = cat_jfk,  \n       direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"), main = \"Combined Mosaic Plot for JFK\", rot_labels=c(0,0,45,90), highlighting_fill=c(\"cyan\",\"lightblue\", \"cornflowerblue\", \"navy\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(Precipitation ~ Temperature + WindSpeed, data = cat_nwk,  \n       direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"), main = \"Combined Mosaic Plot for NWK\", rot_labels=c(0,0,45,90), highlighting_fill=c(\"cyan\",\"lightblue\", \"cornflowerblue\", \"navy\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmosaic(Precipitation ~ Temperature + WindSpeed, data = cat_lga,  \n       direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"), main = \"Combined Mosaic Plot for LGA\", rot_labels=c(0,0,45,90), highlighting_fill=c(\"cyan\",\"lightblue\", \"cornflowerblue\", \"navy\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this analysis, we transformed the continuous variables into categorical ones by establishing specific thresholds. Precipitation was designated as the dependent variable, under the hypothesis that it might be influenced by variations in wind speed and temperature.\nRegarding the relationship between temperature and precipitation, the data reveals a notable trend: the highest precipitation levels are recorded when temperatures are in the “Mild” range (55-65°F). This pattern is evident in the JFK dataset but is less distinct in the LGA dataset.\nWhen examining the interaction between wind speed and precipitation, the mosaic plots for JFK and LGA display a consistent trend: an increase in wind speed generally correlates with higher levels of precipitation. However, this trend does not apply to the NWK dataset. In NWK, an interesting divergence is observed – at a “Comfortable” temperature range, precipitation levels tend to decrease as wind speed increases, contrasting with the patterns seen in JFK and LGA. This discrepancy highlights the complex and location-specific nature of these environmental variables.\n##Distribution analysis for each variable comparing different airports\n\n\nCode\nsp_data_abb &lt;- sp_data\nsp_data_abb$NAME &lt;- ifelse(sp_data_abb$NAME == \"LAGUARDIA AIRPORT, NY US\", \"LGA\", \n                 ifelse(sp_data_abb$NAME == \"NEWARK LIBERTY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, NJ US\", \"NWK\", \"JFK\"))\n\n\nboxplot(Temperature ~ NAME, data = sp_data_abb, main = \"Boxplot for Temperature\", xlab = \"Location\", ylab = \"Temperature\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(Precipitation ~ NAME, data = sp_data_abb, main = \"Boxplot for Precipitation\", xlab = \"Location\", ylab = \"Precipitation\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nboxplot(WindSpeed ~ NAME, data = sp_data_abb, main = \"Boxplot for Wind Speed\", xlab = \"Location\", ylab = \"Wind Speed\")\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the box plot, it’s evident that JFK experiences the lowest median temperature and the highest median wind speed among the three locations. Conversely, NWK exhibits the highest median temperature and the lowest median wind speed. In terms of precipitation, a common trend across all three locations is that a majority of the recorded values are zero. Additionally, the presence of outliers in wind speed across all three locations indicates sporadic occurrences of unusually high wind speeds. This could point to infrequent but significant meteorological events or possibly data recording anomalies.\n##Another approach to visualize distributions\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\nggplot(sp_data_abb, aes(x = Temperature, y = NAME, fill = NAME)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Ridgeline Plot for Temperature\", x = \"Temperature\", y = \"Location\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 4.06\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(sp_data_abb, aes(x = Precipitation, y = NAME, fill = NAME)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Ridgeline Plot for Precipitation\", x = \"Precipitation\", y = \"Location\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 0.00986\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(sp_data_abb, aes(x = WindSpeed, y = NAME, fill = NAME)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(title = \"Ridgeline Plot for Wind Speed\", x = \"Wind Speed\", y = \"Location\") +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 0.913\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ridgeline plot analysis largely corroborates the insights gleaned from the boxplot analysis. It reveals that the temperature distributions across all three airports are quite similar, indicating a consistent temperature range. For precipitation, the distributions are heavily skewed to the right, with most values concentrated near zero. This skewness reflects a predominant absence of precipitation, punctuated by occasional higher values. In terms of wind speed, the distribution for NWK is notably more right-skewed compared to JFK and LGA, suggesting a generally lower wind speed at NWK. Additionally, NWK displays a shorter tail in its distribution, indicating fewer instances of extremely high wind speeds compared to the other two airports. This pattern is reflected in NWK’s lower median wind speed, as observed in the boxplot analysis."

    "text": "Our exploratory analysis of precipitation, wind, and temperature at New York’s airports, while constrained by the scope of the dataset, has yielded insightful findings. A prominent discovery is the uncharacteristic peak in precipitation during September across JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark airports. This peak diverges from the expected precipitation patterns in New York’s typical rainy season and aligns with historical records, highlighting an unusually wet September. However, it’s important to acknowledge that our analysis, being confined to three locations, cannot be extrapolated to the wider New York State area with complete certainty.\nNewark Airport exhibited distinctive weather patterns in comparison to JFK and LaGuardia. Notably, Newark consistently registered lower wind speeds at comparable precipitation levels, which may reflect its unique geographical attributes. Additionally, the data for Newark Airport was notably more right-skewed, indicating generally lower wind speeds at this airport.\nThe limitations of our dataset underscore the necessity for a more expansive collection of data to fully understand and predict weather patterns. The absence of a specified timeframe for the dataset constrains our ability to identify long-term climatic trends and anomalies. A dataset encompassing multiple years or decades would be invaluable in this regard. Enhanced data collection and a broader temporal scope would significantly improve the application of exploratory analysis techniques, paving the way for more robust findings and informed decision-making."
