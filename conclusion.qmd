Our exploratory analysis of precipitation, wind, and temperature at New York's airports, while constrained by the scope of the dataset, has yielded insightful findings. A prominent discovery is the uncharacteristic peak in precipitation during September across JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark airports. This peak diverges from the expected precipitation patterns in New York's typical rainy season and aligns with historical records, highlighting an unusually wet September. However, it's important to acknowledge that our analysis, being confined to three locations, cannot be extrapolated to the wider New York State area with complete certainty.

Newark Airport exhibited distinctive weather patterns in comparison to JFK and LaGuardia. Notably, Newark consistently registered lower wind speeds at comparable precipitation levels, which may reflect its unique geographical attributes. Additionally, the data for Newark Airport was notably more right-skewed, indicating generally lower wind speeds at this airport.

The limitations of our dataset underscore the necessity for a more expansive collection of data to fully understand and predict weather patterns. The absence of a specified timeframe for the dataset constrains our ability to identify long-term climatic trends and anomalies. A dataset encompassing multiple years or decades would be invaluable in this regard. Enhanced data collection and a broader temporal scope would significantly improve the application of exploratory analysis techniques, paving the way for more robust findings and informed decision-making.
